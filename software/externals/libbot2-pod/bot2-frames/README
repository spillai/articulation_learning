Name:         bot2-frames
Maintainers:  
Summary:      A library that manages a set of coordinate frames.
Description:  
  bot2-frames reads the coordinate frame setup information from a parameter file stored by bot2-param

=================
Requirements: 
    GLib (>= 2.0)
    LCM  (http://lcm.googlecode.com)
    bot2-core
    bot2-param
	bot2-vis (optional, for renderer)
	
=================
Param File Format:
	bot2-frames assumes specific param-file format, an example of which is shown below

	
coordinate_frames {
   root_frame = "local";                 #a root_frame must be defined

   body {
     relative_to = "local";
     history = 1000;                    #number of past transforms to keep around,
     update_channel = "BODY_TO_LOCAL";  #transform updates will be listened for on this channel
     initial_transform{
       translation = [ 0, 0, 0 ];         #(x,y,z) translation vector
       quat = [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ];           #may be specified as a quaternion, rpy, rodrigues, or axis-angle
     }
   }
   laser {
     relative_to = "body";
     history = 0;                       #if set to 0, transform will not be updated
     update_channel = "";               #ignored since history=0
     initial_transform{
       translation = [ 0, 0, 0 ];
       rpy = [ 0, 0, 0 ];
     }
   }
   camera {
     relative_to = "body";
     history = 0;
     initial_transform{
       translation = [ 0, 0, 0 ];
       rodrigues = [ 0, 0, 0 ];
     }
   }
  #etc...
}
