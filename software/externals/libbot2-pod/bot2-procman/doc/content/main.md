# Introduction {#procman_introduction}

Procman is a set of tools for managing multiple processes distributed across
one or more hosts.

A single GUI provides the following features:
- start, stop, and restart processes
- view process-level CPU/memory usage and console output
- group processes together (e.g., the "controls" group) for organization
- run simple scripts

In addition to the GUI, there is also a Python API for more programmatic
control of processes.
