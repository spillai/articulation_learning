Name:         bot2-lcmgl
Maintainers:  
Summary:      Transmit OpenGL commands over LCM, and render them elsewhere.
Description:  
  bot2-lcmgl contains a set of client libraries in C, Java, and Python
  for transmitting OpenGL commands over LCM.  It also provides routines
  for receiving and rendering these commands in either a standalone
  application (bot-lcmgl-viewer), or incorporated into another
  C/C++ application.

  A nice attribute of the client libraries is that they do not depend on
  any OpenGL libraries, and only require LCM.

Requirements: FILL-ME-IN
  General requirements:

  LCM
  GTK+ (>= 2.0)
  OpenGL 
  GLUT / FreeGLUT
  Java
  Python

  Requires the following pods, which are distributed as part of libbot2:

  bot2-core
  bot2-vis
